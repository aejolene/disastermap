### Using the Digital Index of North American Archaeology for Rapid Disaster Response and Reporting

**Jolene Smith, David G. Anderson, Eric Kansa, Joshua Wells, and Stephen Yerka**

Strong and erratic weather events, and general sea level rise, as products of global climate change projected for future decades, have significant likelihood to ultimately impact a large but unpredictable fraction of both pre-Columbian and historic human habitation of the coastal margin of the Southeast. While archaeologists have raised alarm about the prospect of climate change related destruction, the lack of comprehensive data about archaeological sites has made it difficult to understand the nature and scope of the threats. The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA), a multi-institutional collaboration aggregating archaeological data from multiple sources, provides a new window on the scope of the challenge.

Via Open Context, an archaeological data publishing service, DINAA publicly and openly publishes “site file” data curated by state officials from multiple US states. By ontologically mapping the state datasets together into a common schema and indexing with common metadata, DINAA enables a more global picture of a common platform to enable federal, state, and local governmental heritage resource managers and the general public alike to meet through a shared public scientific resource to identify priorities for protection in a preparatory manner, and reporting of impacts in the aftermath of a weather event. 

In order to create the DINAA system, the project aggregates and renders interoperable the scientific and cultural descriptors utilized by state archaeological site files, all utilized as a base layer. The base layer is then enhanced through a linked open data (LOD) framework to provide further detail about available information such as Federal Register article reporting, academic journal references, and databases available from a variety of governmental, scientific, and curational sources. In combination, these data combine to form a window of archaeological big data through which a viewer may gain a sense of the overall characteristics of heritage resources present within any area of interest. The area of interest may be defined within DINAA’s spatial interface, or by utilizing the DINAA data structure to inform a GIS analysis conducted with more precise coordinates held in governmental heritage offices.

Disaster response models across a wide variety of needs and disciplines all converge on the importance and necessity of topical tools for the government and public to interact and communicate regarding developments and needs within particular arenas. Thus, while long-range planning is critical, climate impacts often necessitate rapid response by local, state, and federal entities. Simple awareness of the presence of sensitive historic resources within an impacted area can facilitate stabilization and prevent further, inadvertent damage during disaster response efforts. The non-sensitive nature of DINAA data allows for open distribution without fear of endangering sites to looting and without the time consuming process of vetting authorized information viewers. A set of comparative use scenarios for DINAA to facilitate intragovernmental, intergovernmental, and government-to-public communications and example response activities will be discussed.
